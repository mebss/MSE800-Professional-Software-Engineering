## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- Python package manager (pip)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up MySQL Database:**
   - Open your MySQL client.
   - Create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE car_rental_auckland;
     ```
   - Update the `config.ini` file in the root directory with your MySQL credentials:
     ```ini
     [mysql]
     host = localhost
     user = your_username
     password = your_password
     database = car_rental_auckland
     ```

3. **Initialize the Database:**
   Run the `main.py` file to initialize the database tables and create the default admin user:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The system will create the necessary tables and a default admin account.

## Configuration

### Configuring the Database
The database configuration is stored in the `config.ini` file. Ensure you update the file with your MySQL credentials. Here is the structure:

```ini
[mysql]
host = localhost
user = your_username
password = your_password
database = car_rental_auckland
```

### Adding Initial Data
To add initial data like car details or user accounts, you can modify the `main.py` script or directly insert records into the database via MySQL client.

## Usage

### Running the Application
To start the Car Rental System, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### User Roles
- **Admin:** Can manage cars, approve/reject rentals, and view all users.
- **Customer:** Can browse available cars, book rentals, and get car recommendations.

### Features
- **Car Management:** Admins can add, update, or delete car records.
- **Rental Management:** Admins can approve or reject rental requests.
- **Car Recommendations:** Users can receive car recommendations based on their preferences or rental history.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application. Initializes the database and starts the CLI.
- `models/`: Contains all the data models (User, Car, Rental) that represent the database tables.
- `controllers/`: Contains controllers that manage the business logic and database interactions for users, cars, and rentals.
- `views/cli.py`: Handles the command-line interface (CLI) and user interactions.
- `utils/io_utils.py`: Contains utility functions for handling input/output operations.
- `controllers/ai_recommendation.py`: Provides AI-based car recommendations.
- `config.ini`: Configuration file for the MySQL database connection.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python packages required by the system.
- `README.md`: This file, providing detailed information about the system.

## Known Issues
- **Login Issues:** Some users may experience problems logging in due to incorrect password hashing. Ensure that the database is correctly set up and the `bcrypt` library is properly installed.
- **AI Recommendations:** The recommendation system might not always return results if the userâ€™s preferences are too specific or there is insufficient data in the database.
